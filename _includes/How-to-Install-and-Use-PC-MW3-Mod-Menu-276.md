If you are a fan of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and want to spice up your gameplay, you might be interested in installing and using a mod menu. A mod menu is a custom script that allows you to access various features and options that are not normally available in the game. For example, you can change your weapons, perks, killstreaks, maps, modes, themes, and more.

In this article, we will show you how to install and use the PC MW3 Mod Menu 276 by AssumingAgate. Before we begin, please note that using mod menus may violate the game's terms of service and result in a ban or suspension from online play. Use them at your own risk.
 
## How to Install PC MW3 Mod Menu 276
 
To install the PC MW3 Mod Menu 276 by AssumingAgate, you will need to download the mod menu file from this link: [https://cabconmodding.com/threads/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-steam-pc-mod-menu-generations-by-assumingagate-download.216/](https://cabconmodding.com/threads/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-steam-pc-mod-menu-generations-by-assumingagate-download.216/)
 
Once you have downloaded the file, extract it to your desktop or any folder of your choice. You should see a folder named "Mod Menu 276" that contains two files: "ModMenu.dll" and "ModMenu.ini".
 
Next, you will need to inject the mod menu into the game. To do this, you will need an injector program that can inject DLL files into processes. There are many injectors available online, but we recommend using Extreme Injector v3.7.3 by master131. You can download it from this link: [https://www.mpgh.net/forum/showthread.php?t=1210350](https://www.mpgh.net/forum/showthread.php?t=1210350)
 
Once you have downloaded and extracted Extreme Injector v3.7.3, run it as administrator. You should see a window like this:

Click on the "Add DLL" button and browse to the folder where you extracted the Mod Menu 276 files. Select the "ModMenu.dll" file and click on "Open". You should see it added to the list of DLLs.
 
Next, click on the "Settings" button and make sure that these options are checked:
 
- Auto-Inject
- Close on Inject
- Erase PE Headers
- Stealth Inject

Click on "OK" to save the settings.
 
Now, launch Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 from Steam and wait for it to load. Once you are in the main menu of the game, go back to Extreme Injector v3.7.3 and click on the "Select" button next to the process name field. A list of processes will appear. Select "iw5mp.exe" (for multiplayer) or "iw5sp.exe" (for singleplayer) and click on "OK". You should see the process name appear in the field.
 
Finally, click on the "Inject" button and wait for a few seconds. You should see a message saying "Injection successful!" and Extreme Injector v3.7.3 will close automatically.
 
Congratulations! You have successfully installed the PC MW3 Mod Menu 276 by AssumingAgate.
