Joe's Adventures is one of the three downloadable content (DLC) packs for Mafia 2. It was released in November 2010 and features a new storyline that focuses on Joe Barbaro, Vito's best friend and partner in crime. The DLC takes place during the six years that Vito spends in prison, and shows how Joe rises through the ranks of the Mafia while dealing with betrayal, revenge, and corruption.
 
The DLC adds new missions, locations, vehicles, weapons, music, and achievements to the game. Some of the new missions include robbing a supermarket, infiltrating a brothel, racing on a highway, and sabotaging a rival gang. Some of the new locations include a dam, a subway station, a yacht club, and a warehouse. Some of the new vehicles include a Delizia Grandeamerica sports car, a limousine, and a truck. Some of the new weapons include a shotgun, a revolver, and a grenade launcher.
 
The DLC also introduces new gameplay features such as new fighting styles, new enemies, and seasonally changing weather. Joe can use different melee moves depending on his weapon and his opponent. He can also face new types of enemies such as dockyard mobsters, SWAT officers, and Rocco's crew. The weather changes from sunny to snowy depending on the time of year.
 
The DLC has received mixed reviews from critics and players. Some praised the DLC for its fun and varied missions, its humor and dialogue, its new content and features, and its low price. Others criticized the DLC for its short length, its lack of connection to the main story, its technical issues and bugs, and its repetitive gameplay.
 
Overall, Joe's Adventures is a DLC that offers more of the same Mafia 2 experience with some new twists and additions. It is recommended for fans of the game who want to see more of Joe's personality and adventures. It is not recommended for those who expect a deep and meaningful story or a flawless gameplay.
  
One of the highlights of Joe's Adventures is the new music that plays during the missions and on the radio. The DLC features over 20 new songs from the 1940s and 1950s, including classics by Louis Prima, Dean Martin, Rosemary Clooney, and The Andrews Sisters. The music adds to the atmosphere and the mood of the game, and fits well with Joe's character and style.
 
Another highlight of Joe's Adventures is the new Playboy magazines that can be collected throughout the game. The DLC adds 19 new magazines to the original 50, bringing the total to 69. The magazines feature photos and articles from the real-life Playboy magazine of the era, and provide some historical and cultural context to the game. The magazines also serve as a reward and a challenge for the players who want to find them all.
 
One of the drawbacks of Joe's Adventures is the lack of interaction with other characters from the main game. The DLC does not feature any cutscenes or dialogues with Vito, Henry, Eddie, or other important characters. The only character that Joe talks to regularly is Tony Balls, his contact and friend. The DLC also does not show how Joe's actions affect the events of the main story, or how he reacts to Vito's arrest and release. The DLC feels like a standalone story that has little connection to the main game.
 
Another drawback of Joe's Adventures is the technical issues and bugs that plague the game. The DLC suffers from frequent crashes, freezes, glitches, and errors that can ruin the gameplay experience. Some of the issues include missing textures, invisible walls, disappearing cars, broken physics, and corrupted saves. The DLC also has some problems with its difficulty and balance, as some missions are too easy or too hard, and some enemies are too weak or too strong.
